## US Mobile Front End Coding Exercise

The front end coding exercise is meant to fairly evaluate a candidate with the least amount of effort (~ 4 hours) to come up with a working prototype of a sign up page.

## Motivation

The exercise has been structured around the work style that US Mobile front end engineers and product design teams engage in to come out with fantastic visual experiences.

## Design Screens

Internally we use Figma to share UX designs with front end engineers. The UX design can be found at
