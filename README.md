## Engineering Constraints

- Create a feature branch. Naming convention to follow is feature/signup*page*<Name of the candidate>
- Please use React
- The code should be type covered, either is fine Typescript or FlowType
- Prefer javascript based styling approach, JSS/styled-components etc.
- Write tests using jest and react-testing-library
- The page(s) should be mobile and desktop friendly. They should render properly on both.
- Other design choices are left to the candidate eg; Leverage either node js based API for client-server integration or we do use firebase internally.
- Update the read me file to run the code
- Raise a pull request for review
